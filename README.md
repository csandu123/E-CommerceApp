# Back End E-Commerce Application

Welcome to my back end E-Commerce application! This was made with the intention of being able to view, update, delete and create new products and tags for a business looking to manage their inventory. 

## Requirements and Instructions

This application does require the use and installation of the dotenv, sequelize and MYSQL2 packages. After sourcing the schema file and creating your database, use NPM run seed to populate the seed data, and use NPM start to begin listening on your desired port. 

## For a video of how to invoke and use the application, check out the following link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/zrqnr8k5de9q4t7/server.js%20-%20EcommerceBackend%20-%20Visual%20Studio%20Code%202022-10-04%2018-20-15.mp4?dl=0
